@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}

<!--
    By including this code in the _ViewStart.cshtml file, you're effectively specifying that the default layout for all views 
    using this _ViewStart.cshtml file is _Layout.cshtml. This means that when a view is rendered, it will use the _Layout.cshtml 
    file as its layout template unless specified otherwise.

    For example, with our view Index.cshtml, and we haven't explicitly set a layout for it, it will automatically use
    the _Layout.cshtml file as its layout template, thanks to the code in _ViewStart.cshtml.
